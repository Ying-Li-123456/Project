1. Project role: In milestone 1, I am the project manager in the first two weeks because team members rotated as project managers. In milestone 2, I'm mainly responsible for the front-end work, such as designing filter, login page and creating user login system. I present the data parsed by C++ in the form of HTML file in the web page.
2. Contributions: I am mainly responsible for the front-end work. In the first milestone stage, I used HTML to define the outline of the web page, CSS to locate the displayed elements, and then JavaScript to achieve the corresponding effect and interaction. In the second stage of milestone, I use Ajax to exchange data between client and server instead of the whole page document to realize partial page update. JQuery is a framework that encapsulates JS to make it easier to use. JQuery makes the use of JS and Ajax more convenient, so I have completed the most core part of the front-end - navigation bar, filter, login page and administration system. 
3. Average hours investigated to the project: In the development, I used to spent 25 hours per week on this project.
